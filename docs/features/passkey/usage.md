# Passkey Support

Passkeys are more secure than traditional passwords because they are longer 
and harder to crack. They are resistant to dictionary and rainbow table attacks.
They lack personal information, making them more resistant to social 
engineering attacks. Overall, passkeys offer improved security and usability.

>***HINT**: If you have passkeys enabled in your application you're no longer able 
to use Two-Factor Auth.*
