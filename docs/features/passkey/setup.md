# Setup

To enable Passkeys set `enable_passkey => true` in the ``filament-startify.php`` config:

```php:no-line-numbers
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Startify Passkey Support
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Passkeys are more secure than traditional passwords because they
| are longer and harder to crack. They are resistant to 
| dictionary and rainbow table attacks. The future is
| passwordless.

*/

'enable_passkey' => true,

```
